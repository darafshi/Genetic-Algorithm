Solving a sample problem with GA

Many years ago, I think that was about 2014 or 2015, I was an AI student in master level at AUT in Tehran. I was working on solving a sample problem with GA under supervisory of Prof. Somayeh Molaei. after many years I found that code and published it on GitHub. now you can check and use it under the MIT License.
